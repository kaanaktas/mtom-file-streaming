# mtom-file-streaming
This project demonstrates how big attachements are transfered via Soap messages by using Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism(MTOM). 
SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) is the use of MIME to optimize the bitstream transmission of SOAP messages that contain significantly large base64Binary elements.
Instead of using in-line attechment, MTOM provides great opportunities to handle big size attachments even larger than the allocated memory. So, both client side and server side are easily transfer their attachments without any concern.
